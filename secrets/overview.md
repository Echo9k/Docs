Secrets allow you to store sensitive information at the team, private cluster, and project level. The secrets you create are available to use in experiments run on private clusters.

Secrets can be created at the following levels:

* Team: these secrets are applied to all projects and all clusters
* Project: these secrets are applied to all experiments in a project
* Cluster: these secrets are applied to all experiments in a cluster

Secrets can be set from the Settings tab in the web UI or through the CLI.
