# Get started with Workflows

For a quick introduction to workflows see the [Workflows](/get-started/quick-start#create-a-workflow) section in the Quick Start guide.

For a step-by-step introduction using the Gradient CLI see the [Workflows](/gradient/explore-train-deploy/workflows/getting-started-with-workflows) section of the docs.

For more examples see the other tutorials to the left: The [End-to-End example](/gradient/get-started/tutorials-list/end-to-end-example) shows building a DL Recommender both in a notebook and in a workflow.
