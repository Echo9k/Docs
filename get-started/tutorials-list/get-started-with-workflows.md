# Get started with Workflows

For a quick introduction to workflows see the [Workflows](../quick-start/#create-a-workflow) section in the Quick Start guide.

For a step-by-step introduction using the Gradient CLI see the [Workflows](../../explore-train-deploy/workflows/getting-started-with-workflows.md) section of the docs.

For more examples see the other tutorials to the left: The [End-to-End example](end-to-end-example.md) shows building a DL Recommender both in a notebook and in a workflow.
