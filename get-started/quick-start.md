# Quick Start

## Prerequisites

To begin using Gradient, follow these preliminary steps:

1. [Create a Paperspace account ](https://www.paperspace.com/account/signup)
2. [Create a team to invite collaborators](https://support.paperspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010359213-Creating-and-Managing-Paperspace-Teams)

Now you can create Notebooks, Projects, Workflows, Models, Deployments, and more!  Note: if you are self-hosting Gradient, please visit the [Gradient Private Cloud section](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/gradient-private-cloud/about) for more info.

## Logging into the Paperspace Console for the first time

When you first log into the Paperspace Console, you'll choose Gradient or Core, depending on whether you want to perform machine learning or to use cloud infrastructure directly.

You can always switch products later by clicking the Product Selector at the top-left of the Console and then selecting Gradient, Core, or your Paperspace Teams & Account settings.

## Create a Notebook

Notebooks can be created on the Notebooks tab. Just select a [template](../notebooks/about/create-a-notebook/notebook-containers/), choose your [instance type](../instance-types/), and then click create. 

{% hint style="success" %}
Check out the [FREE GPU](../instance-types/free-instances.md) option when launching Notebooks!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Check out the [ML Showcase](https://ml-showcase.paperspace.com/) for a list of projects you can fork into your own account
{% endhint %}

You can stop, start, fork, and swap out the instance type anytime. Choose from a wide selection of pre-configured templates or bring your own.

## Advanced MLOps

{% hint style="warning" %}
Using advanced ML components contained within Projects requires [creating a cluster](../gradient-private-cloud/about/setup/managed-installation.md).   
{% endhint %}

### Create a Project

Projects organize your work.  To create a Project, navigate to **Gradient** &gt; **Projects** in the UI and click **Create Project**, provide a name, and click **create**. Now, you can use the created Project's **Project ID** in order to create workloads in that Project via the CLI.

### Running your first Workflow

You can run Workflows from the web interface or CLI:

{% hint style="info" %}
Before creating an experiment using the CLI, you must first [install the CLI](core-concepts/install-the-cli.md). 
{% endhint %}

**Run a sample project**

The following command will work and will create and start an Experiment that will display properties of the attached GPU. Be sure to replace `<your-project-id>` with your **Project ID** and `<your-cluster-id>` with your **Cluster ID**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** We recommend stashing your API key with `gradient apiKey XXXXXXXXXXXXX` or you can add your API key as an option on each Experiment. See [Connecting Your Account](core-concepts/install-the-cli.md#connecting-your-account).
{% endhint %}

```bash
gradient workflows run --projectId <your-project-id> --clusterId <your-cluster-id> --container 'Test-Container' --machineType P4000 --command 'nvidia-smi' --name 'test-01' --workspace none --apiKey <your-api-key>
```

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-09-at-6.40.00-pm.png)

Behind the scenes, your Workflow will be executed on your cluster starting with the command you provided. You can always use the `--help` option after any command in the CLI for more info.  

Congratulations! You ran your first Experiment on Gradient ðŸš€

## Explore the rest of the platform

From [Models](../models/about/) to [Deployments](../deployments/about.md), there's a lot more to the Gradient platform.  We recommend using the Web UI to explore the primary components and also be sure to install the [CLI](core-concepts/install-the-cli.md) and check out the [SDK](../gradient-python-sdk-1/).
