# Quick Start

## Prerequisites

To begin using Gradient, follow these preliminary steps:

1. [Create a Paperspace account ](https://console.paperspace.com/signup?gradient=true)
2. Optional: [Create a team ](https://support.paperspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010359213-Creating-and-Managing-Paperspace-Teams)to invite collaborators

Now you can create Notebooks, Workflows, Models, Deployments, and more! Note: if you are self-hosting Gradient, please visit the [Gradient Private Cloud ](../../gradient-private-cloud/about/setup/self-hosted-clusters/)section for more info.

{% endhint %}

## Logging in for the first time

When you first log into the Paperspace Console, you can select Gradient from the product dropdown:

## Create a Notebook

Notebooks can be created on the Notebooks tab. Just select a [template](../../explore-train-deploy/notebooks/create-a-notebook/notebook-containers/), choose your [instance type](../../more/instance-types/), and then click create.

{% hint style="success" %}
Check out the [FREE GPU](../../more/instance-types/free-instances.md) option when launching Notebooks!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Check out the [ML Showcase](https://ml-showcase.paperspace.com/) for a list of projects you can fork into your own account
{% endhint %}

You can stop, start, fork, and swap out the instance type anytime. Choose from a wide selection of pre-configured templates or bring your own. View the overview video to learn more:

## Workflows and MLOps

You can perform advanced MLOps functions using Workflows, Models and Deployments. Workflows allow you to work with Data, Models, and Deployments in a reproducible and fully tracked manner. You can define a workflow one time using a text editor and use it repeatedly to perform simple or complex MLOps activities, such as pre-processing data, training models, creating/updating deployments, and/or performing inference.

### Create a Project

Projects organize your work. To create a Project, navigate to **Projects** and click **Create Project**, provide a name, and click **create**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-04-22-at-11.46.07-am.png)

Make a note of the projectId, for example `pr1234567`.

### Running your first Workflow

You can run Workflows from the web interface or CLI. First you need to create a new Workflow. This will allow you to keep track of related runs of the Workflow.

If you have never run a workflow before you can create and run a demo workflow all in one step in the web interface, by clicking on the Workflows tab within the project, then clicking the **Create Your First Workflow** button. This will create a Workflow named `demo workflow` and a dataset named `demo-dataset`. The resulting images generated by the running the workflow will be stored in the dataset.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-08-11-at-08.33.34-pm.png)

Follow the instructions on the page to run the workflow as is, or download the Workflow Spec and run it from the CLI.

### **Run Workflow from the CLI**

1. [**Install the Gradient CLI**](install-the-cli.md)
2. [**Connect your account**](install-the-cli.md#connecting-your-account)
3. **Create a Workflow**

   This step is only needed if you didn't already create a default `demo workflow` in the web interface. Specify a name for the Workflow and a `projectId`. Use the `projectId` from the project you created earlier.

   ```bash
   gradient workflows create  \ 
   --name <your-workflow-name>  \
   --projectId <your-project-id>
   ```

   To see a list of your projects and `projectIds` run `gradient projects list`. For a list of Workflows within a project run `gradient workflows list --projectId <your-project-id>`.

4. **Download or copy the sample Workflow Spec from the web interface to your computer**

   Here is the Workflow Spec for reference:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     CloneRepo:
       resources:
         instance-type: C5
       outputs:
         repo:
           type: volume
       uses: git-checkout@v1
       with:
      url: https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2.git
     StyleGan2:
       resources:
         instance-type: P4000
       needs:
         - CloneRepo
       inputs:
         repo: CloneRepo.outputs.repo
       outputs:
         generatedFaces:
           type: dataset
           with:
             ref: demo-dataset
       uses: script@v1
       with:
         script: |-
           pip install scipy==1.3.3
           pip install requests==2.22.0
           pip install Pillow==6.2.1
           cp -R /inputs/repo /stylegan2
           cd /stylegan2
           python run_generator.py generate-images \
             --network=gdrive:networks/stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pkl \
             --seeds=6600-6605 \
             --truncation-psi=0.5 \
             --result-dir=/outputs/generatedFaces
         image: tensorflow/tensorflow:1.14.0-gpu-py3
   ```

   Place the contents in a file named `workflow.yaml`.

5. **Run the Workflow from the CLI**

   The following command will run an instance of the Workflow in your project. Be sure to replace `<your-workflow-id>` with your **Workflow ID**.

   ```bash
   gradient workflows run  \ 
   --id <your-workflow-id>  \
   --path ./workflow.yaml
   ```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** We recommend stashing your API key with `gradient apiKey XXXXXXXXXXXXX` or you can add your API key as an option on each command. See [Connecting Your Account](install-the-cli.md#connecting-your-account).
{% endhint %}

Behind the scenes, your Workflow will be executed on the Gradient public cluster. Congratulations! You ran your first Workflow on Gradient ðŸš€

## Explore the rest of the platform

From [Models](../../data/models/) to [Deployments](../../explore-train-deploy/deployments/), there's a lot more to the Gradient platform. We recommend using the Web UI to explore the primary components and also be sure to install the [CLI](install-the-cli.md) and check out the [SDK](../../more/gradient-python-sdk-1/).
