Tagging is a powerful feature in Gradient that allows teams to organize and track machine learning work.

A tag is an alphanumeric word or phrase scoped to a team, which team members can add to any taggable entity type: Projects, Experiments, Notebooks, Jobs, Models, and Deployments.

Entities can then be filtered by tag for easy access and oversight.

Team admins and entity creators can create and add tags to entities, and all team members can filter any entity list by any tag. Whenever a team member adds a tag that doesn't already exist within their team, the tag becomes available across all entity types for adding and filtering.
