  Gradient Deployments enable a hassle-free, automatic “push to deploy” option
  for any trained model. These allow ML practitioners to quickly validate
  “end-to-end” services, from R&D to production.

# Overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
This section of the documentation covers our previous generation of Gradient. For the current version go to [Gradient Next](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient).
{% endhint %}

Deploy any model as a high-performance, low-latency micro-service with a RESTful API. Easily monitor, scale, and version deployments. Deployments take a trained model and expose them as a persistent service at a known, secure URL endpoint.

Gradient makes it easy to deploy your trained model into production so that you can start generating predictions for real-time or batch data. Just specify the type of instance and the autoscaling behavior and Gradient takes care of the rest. Gradient will launch the instances, deploy your model, and set up the secure HTTPS endpoint for your application.
