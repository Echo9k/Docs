# Overview

A Gradient Project is a workspace for you or your team to run Workflows, store Models, and manage Deployments. Projects create an additional isolation layer of organization and control \(e.g. managing access\) within your team.  You can [create a project](managing-projects.md#create-a-project) in the web UI or the CLI.
