# Stop a Notebook

Click the _Stop_ button to stop your Notebook from running. When your Notebook is stopped, the billing session will end. You'll see how long your Running Time was for the latest session. We then snapshot your notebooks container to include any installed or updated packages and upload a copy of your workspace files, controlled by your [notebook include file](../../notebook-include.md), so you can view them in the console or share them with forks.
