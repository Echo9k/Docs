# Models

The Gradient model repository is a hub for importing, managing, and deploying ML models. 

![Models are available within projects](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-01-18-at-10.12.57-pm%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29.png)

Gradient Models can be created in two ways: 

1. Generate models from your workloads i.e. Workflows or Notebooks
2. Import into Gradient by uploading them directly from the Web UI or CLI. Learn more [here](create-a-model/).

Gradient has a repository of Models per [project](../../get-started/managing-projects/). The model repository holds reference to the model artifacts \(files generated during training\) as well as optional summary metrics associated with the model's performance such as accuracy and loss.

**Supported Model formats:**

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)
* ONNX \(Open Neural Network Exchange\) 
* Custom
