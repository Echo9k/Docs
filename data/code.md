# Code

Notebooks, Workflows, and Deployments include source code integrations to connect and track your code.  

[GradientCI](https://gradient.paperspace.com/gradientci) is our current implementation of source control integration which supports both tracking commits \(or branches\) as well as optionally feeding Gradient model performance metrics back into GitHub.  This tool is supported in an enterprise version of Gradient which is being deprecated in favor of [Workflows](../explore-train-deploy/workflows/).  Workflows support pulling your code as a Gradient action called `git-checkout` , which you can learn about [here](../explore-train-deploy/workflows/gradient-actions.md#git-checkout).
