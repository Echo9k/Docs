# Code

[GradientCI](https://gradient.paperspace.com/gradientci) is our current implementation of source control integration which supports both tracking commits \(or branches\) as well as optionally feeding Gradient model performance metrics back into GitHub.  This tool is supported in a legacy version of Gradient which is being deprecated in favor of [Workflows](../explore-train-deploy/workflows-1/).  GradientCI is **not** yet supported in Workflows â€” stay tuned for updates.  Workflows does support pulling your code as a Gradient action called `git-checkout` which you can learn about [here](../explore-train-deploy/workflows-1/gradient-actions.md#git-checkout).
