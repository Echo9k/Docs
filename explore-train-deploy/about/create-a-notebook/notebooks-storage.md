# Persistent Storage

### Storing data

Every notebook in your account automatically includes a persistent filesystem. Use this directory to store datasets, model checkpoints, and more.  Learn more [here](../../../data/data-overview/#persistent-storage). Gradient also includes a [public datasets repository](../../../data/data-overview/private-datasets-repository/public-datasets-repository.md).

### `/storage` directory

This is persistent storage which is an NFS mount of a volume on a storage server. This quota/size is determined by the team subscription so can range from 5GB up to 1TB. [Contact sales](https://info.paperspace.com/contact-sales) if you need to increase this limit beyond what is available with the default subscription plans\).
