# File organization

Use the files tab to **upload** data, organize your files and folders, and **download** files stored in your notebook. You'll find most file operations available at the bottom of the files sidebar.  Some options such as renaming files and folders, downloading files, and duplicating files are available by clicking the menu icon on the individual entity.
