# Notebook TensorBoards

You can run Tensorboard and access it via this URL scheme `https://tensorboard.NOTEBOOK.CLUSTER.paperspacegradient.com` 

The notebook ID can be found on the notebook list view or from the notebook page in the URL. The ID is after `/notebook/...`. 

The default notebook cluster ID is `clw6rxq2s`. \(If using a private cluster, you can grab the ID from the clusters page.\) 

Hereâ€™s an example:

Inside the container, the default port of 6006 should still be used.
